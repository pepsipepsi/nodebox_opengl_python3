# nodebox_opengl_python3
Half done port of the wonderful nodebox opengl project to python 3.x. This needs pyglet and python-future. This includes examples from nodebox for opengl and the original nodebox 1.

I didn't like that I needed to use python 2.7 to play with this, so I'm porting it to modern python (python 3.5.1) piece by piece. It's not at 100% yet.

Thanks to the original creators for sharing this code, it's definitely one of the coolest things ever created with python and pyglet.
