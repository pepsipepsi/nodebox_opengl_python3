# nodebox_opengl_python3
Half done port of the wonderful nodebox opengl project to python 3.x. This needs pyglet and python-future.

I didn't like that I needed to use python 2.7 to play with this, so I'm porting it to modern python piece by piece. It's not at 100% yet.

All (?) of the geometry, physics, and shader methods are available. None of the gui or sound stuff works presently, and bezier lines don't work.

This is a pycharm project. Outside of pycharm, python will fail to find the modules (fixing that is on the todo list). The nodebox directory needs to be in the root of the project, or the modules will not be found.

Thanks to the original creators for sharing this code, it's definitely one of the coolest things ever created with python and pyglet.
