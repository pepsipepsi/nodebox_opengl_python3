# nodebox_opengl_python3
Half done port of the wonderful nodebox opengl project to python 3.x. This needs pyglet and python-future. This includes examples from nodebox for opengl and the original nodebox 1.

I didn't like that I needed to use python 2.7 to play with this, so I'm porting it to modern python (python 3.5.1) piece by piece. It's not at 100% yet.

functionality by example groupings (non numbered are the Nodebox 1 examples)

all working

01_basics, 02_transform, 03_image, 04_text, 09_layer
Animation, Grid, Math, Primitives

most working

05_path, 07_filter, 08_physics
Text

none working

06_math, 10_gui, 11_sound
Advanced, Content, Interactivity, Path

Thanks to the original creators for sharing this code, it's definitely one of the coolest things ever created with python and pyglet.
