# nodebox_opengl_python3

creative coding in pure python... 

This is a python 3 port of the wonderful nodebox opengl project! This needs pyglet and python-future to run and includes examples from nodebox for opengl and the original nodebox 1.

This is tested with python 3.5.1.

The core drawing libraries are ported and work almost perfectly. Some specific examples are not working, they're listed below.

Nodebox for OpenGL was created by Frederik De Bleser and Tom De Smedt!
