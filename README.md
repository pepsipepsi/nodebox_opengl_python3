# nodebox_opengl_python3  

creative coding in pure python... created by Frederik De Bleser and Tom De Smedt.  

This is a python 3 port of nodebox opengl! This needs pyglet to run and includes examples from nodebox for opengl and the original nodebox 1.  

If you have pip installed on your system path, or if not find it in your scripts directory and type  

	pip install pyglet  

... and you should be good to go.  

This is tested with python 3.5.1 and works well. Some of the original nodebox 1 examples don't run, but all of the nodebox open gl examples do (they are the ones which are numbered).
